# trello-list-archiver

**trello-list-archiver** is a tiny Trello Power-Up that lets you archive a bunch of Trello lists in a few clicks. It uses regular expressions to match lists by title.

One of the scenarios when it may come handy (that inspired the creation of trello-list-archiver) is using Trello to track daily activities with each day represented by a separate list. It makes it easier to reflect on the work done, fill any reports if you have to, run retrospectives, and much more. Once lists are not needed anymore, i.e., at the end of a month, you can archive them all in a few clicks.

1. On the very first use, it'll prompt you to authorize the Power-Up to access your Trello account -- it's required to modify lists via Trello API.
2. Once authenticated, put a [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) in a search box and press Enter or click _Search_
3. Uncheck any matched list if necessary, and click _Archive Selected_
4. Voila! If you removed something accidentally, there is still a chance to click _Undo Selected_

Enjoy!

## Troubleshooting
In rare cases when authentication token expires or invalidates, you may need to reauthenticate the Power-Up by navigating to *Show Menu - Power-Ups - Custom*, clicking a gear icon next to the trello-list-archiver and choosing _Remove Personal Settings_.

After that, click the gear button again, select _Authorize Account_, and follow the prompts to authorize
